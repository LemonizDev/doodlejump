## How to Play

- Playing Doodle Jump is as easy as moving left or right to reach the different platforms. The gameplay is endless, so jump for as long as possible without falling off to acheive your greatest score.

- The game includes different types of __platforms__ that can be recognised based on their color:

    - ****Green:**** These are the most common platforms and can be jumped on multiple times.
    - ****White:**** These platforms can only be jumped on once.
    - ****Brown:**** Jump on them and you fall right through. 
    - ****Springs:**** These are the most useful platforms. They can be jumped on and give you a boost when you land on them.

- ****Super jumps:**** These are collectible powerups that give a higher jump when accessed. Each time you surpass a score of 100, a [super jump](#super-jump-space) is earned.
