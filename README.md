## How to Play

- Playing Doodle Jump is as easy as moving left or right to reach the different platforms. The gameplay is endless, so jump for as long as possible without falling off to acheive your greatest score.

- The game includes different types of __platforms__ that can be recognised based on their color:

    - ****Green:**** These are the normal platforms that the player can land safely on after every jump
    - ****White:**** These platforms are of one time use. Once you jump on them, they're gone.
    - ****Brown:**** These platforms cannot be jumped on and break if you land on them.
    - ****Springs:**** Need a jump boost? Just land on one of the springs you spot. These provide a higher jump and a definite boost in score

- ****Super jumps:**** These are collectible powerups that give a higher jump when accessed. Each time you surpass a score of 100, a [super jump](#super-jump-space) is earned.
